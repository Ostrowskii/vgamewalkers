currently, in this repository, every time we render a frame, we re-compute the states from the first frame all the way to the last. this is prohibitive: after ~3 minutes or so that a room has been active, vibi.ts will start lagging a lot. our goal is to improve vibi.ts so that it caches past states; that way, when we need to compute the state of tick 50, for example, if we already have state 46 cached (and it is the last one appended to the array), then we only need to recompute 47, 48, 49, 50. note that the user is instructed not to mutate the state on its on_tick/on_post handlers. that means that vibi.ts can assume that's the case. as such, to record a state, we could just hold an array which would store the state of every tick even if doing so would lead to immense space requirements. as soon as the client enters the game, it will compute all the states from initial_tick, append each one to an array, up to the current tick, then for tick current_tick + 1, it will query the state arrays and only compute the new state (and appending it to states array). a smarter strategy would be to simply cache the last state, and update it when a tick/event occurs. yet, note that the tick on which a post occurred is computed based on the post's fields, and that isn't guaranteed to be in order; i.e., a post that we process after could take place in an earlier tick. that's why compute_state_at on vibi.ts first builds a timeline (mapping tick → posts), and only then computes each tick, from beginning to end. because of that, caching the latest state isn't enough; we need to cache, for now, all past states, too. Whenever a new post is received (via client.watch or post), we must calculate its official tick and invalidate (delete) all cached states from that tick onwards

to do so while avoiding space waste, we'll use an immutable rollback list (a logarithmic-space history/undo stack, sometimes called a "skew binary" or "exponentially-spaced snapshot" structure). there is an example on ./rollback.js. it must be ported to .ts, and incorporated into this codebase cleanly. you must reason about it to learn how it works. whenever we compute a tick's state, we push that to this structure. and before computing a tick's state, we make sure to start from the most recent snapshot available. finally, when we receive a new post from the internet, before storing it, we must invalidate snapshot states accordingly. for example, if we receive a post whose official tick is 1700, we must remove all cached states of tick >= 1700 from the cached state rollback list. now, implement these changes, and include a file to test them comprehensively (mock as needed). let me know when you're done.

The walker game works like this: a player enters in a room, types the letter it want to represent and the game is a white canvas where the players can move their choosen letters with AWSD keys, and the game runs at 24 ticks per second, with means that a player that enters 10 hours after the room is created will have to compute 24 * 60 * 60 * 10 = 864.000 ticks, and that said, 864.000 state will be saved in the array states, right (am i wrong?)? Won't that lag too much at the beginning when the user first enters the room and won't the array be too expensive to hold at hour 10?
